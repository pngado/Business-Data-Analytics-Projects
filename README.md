Analytics projects using public datasets 

📌 PROJECT 1: COZYORGANIC RETAIL DATA ANALYSIS 
In this project, I use Excel PivotTable and visualization tools to extract insights from a fictional datatset of Cozyorganic. 

🔎 Context
Cozyorganic is a local organic food supplier and has been supplying the community with affordable organic food and products in Northcote since 1996. It is an organic wholesaler certified by ACO, the most trusted organic certification body in Australia.

The company expanded a few times since then and is now the leading certified organic wholesaler in Melbourne. Cozcyorganic stores are located in 15 different locations in Melbourne: Northcote, Carlton, Docklands, East Melbourne, Kensington and Flemington, North Melbourne, Parkville, Port Melbourne, Southbank, South Yarra - west, West Melbourne, Fitzroy, Princes Hill, Richmond, and Heidelberg. Cozyorganic buys direct, in volume, and keeps our costs low so we can stock the best organic products at competitive wholesale prices. The company finds the best organic food, products, and suppliers on the market so they can stock an innovative and delicious range.

The company’s management believes building and maintaining strong client relationships are important for sustainable business growth.  Therefore, the company offers the best customer service to its customers before or after they buy or use products or services. Customer service includes actions such as offering product suggestions, troubleshooting issues, and complaints or responding to general questions.

Moreover, every year companies conduct Sentiment and Qualitative surveys to better understand their customer's satisfaction and changes to their product or service. This feedback is essential for measuring customer satisfaction among your current customers. Getting a handle on how customers view company products, support, and the company is invaluable.

💡 Topics/Tasks covered:
* Delivered insights and recommnedations on customer satisfaction, monthly sales performance, supplier performance and product preference by region
* Discussed important concepts and processes in text mining - documents, corpus, tokens/terms, text pre-processinng. 
* Used PorterStemmer algorithm for stemming

📌 RPOJECT 2: CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
In this project, I peform Hierarchical Clustering in Python to identify natural segments of customers in the public dataset 'Mall Customer Segmentation Data'. 

🔎 Context
You are owning a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

💡 Topics/Tasks covered:
* Determined the number of clusters (potential customer segments) in the dataset
* Delivered insights on the customers and their spending patterns at the mall
* Performend Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 PROJECT 3: WALMART RETAIL DATA ANALYSIS
In this project, I use different data analysis and visualization techniques in Python to extract insights from the public dataset 'Walmart Dataset (Retail)'. 

🔎 Context 
Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. 
This dataset covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. It has data on the store number, the week of sales, weekly sales for each store, whether the week is a special holiday week, temperature on the day of sale, cost of fuel in the region, prevailing consumer price index, and prevailing unemployment rate. 

💡 Key questions addressed:
* The possible effect of temperature, fuel price, CPI and unemployment on sales 
* Top 5 with the highest sales 
* Which is the store that achieved the highest sales in a single week between 2010-02-05 and 2012-11-01?
* Yearly sales performance during the documented period
* Monthly Sales Performance in 2010, 2011 and 2012
* Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot?
* Do holidays have an impact on shopping behaviour?
* Is there any holiday that has lower sales than the average non-holiday sales?

💡 Topics/Tasks covered:
* Answered the aforementioned questions and provided recommendations accordingly
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
